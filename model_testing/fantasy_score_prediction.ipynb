    "- The model recieves inputs for a specific player in an upcoming game, including their past statistics, team performance metrics, and the opponent's tendencies.\n",
    "2. Feature Extraction:\n",
    "- Advanced features are extracted from the raw data, focusing on factors that influence fantasy scoring.\n",
    "3. Prediction:\n",
    "- The trained machine learning model processes these features and generates a predicted fantasy score for the player.\n",
    "4. Scoring System:\n",
    "- The prediction is based on a standard fantasy scoring system that assigns points for various actions (field goals, rebounds, assists, steals, etc.) and penalizes for negative actions (turnovers)."

    "\n",
    "**Data Collection:**\n",
    "- Gather historical player statistics (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) and team-level data, including defensive matchups and opponent strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "- Extract relevant features, such as shooting efficiency, player role, and minutes played, which are correlated with fantasy point production. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning Algorithms:**\n",
    "- Employ algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, or Neural Networks to build the prediction model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Variable:**\n",
    "- The target variable is typically the player's total fantasy points for a specific game, calculated using a defined scoring system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Training:**\n",
    "- Train the chosen machine learning model on a historical dataset, allowing it to learn the relationships between the input features and the fantasy score. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "- Assess the model's accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)"
